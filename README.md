# 3D Hand Classification using Structure from Motion (SfM)

This repo is contains code and data for Graduate Computer Vision I taught by Adam Czajka in the Fall of 2019. For my semester project, I used SfM to improve segmentation for the classification of different hand poses. The classifier is a simple Support Vector Machine.

Note: 3D Features (although obtained from Colmap) were never used for classification in this project due to... procrastination...
